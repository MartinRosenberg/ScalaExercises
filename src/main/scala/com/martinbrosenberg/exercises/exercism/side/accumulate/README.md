# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

* square a number `(x => x * x)`

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

* 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off the map, flatMap and for comprehension functionality provided by the standard library! Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

# Diamond

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

-   The first row contains one 'A'.
-   The last row contains one 'A'.
-   All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
-   All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
-   The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
-   The diamond is vertically symmetric.
-   The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
-   The letters form a diamond shape.
-   The top half has the letters in ascending order.
-   The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
-   The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

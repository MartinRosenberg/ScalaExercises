# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

_"Hello, World!"_ is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

* Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
* Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
* Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Hints

Common pitfalls that you should avoid

* Usually there is no need in Scala to use `return`. For a discussion see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24856106/return-in-a-scala-function-literal). Or as a quote from that discussion: *Don't use return, it makes Scala cry.*

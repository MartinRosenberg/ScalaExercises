# Scala Exercises

[Scala](https://github.com/scala/scala) solutions to various coding exercises, organized into packages by origin. Some were specifically intended to be solved using Scala, but most were language-agnostic.

Every exercise is tested using [ScalaTest](https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest), and all examples provided are used as test cases.
